# fbpromise
Javascript uber-lightweight Promises/A+ compliant promise implementation used by FireBreath 2.0

# Purpose

There was something that I didn't like about every implementation I found; I needed something *very* lightweight and with a friendly license for embedding inside FireBreath.
This is that implementation =]

# Tests

To run the unit tests (provided by the kind folks at Promises/A+) and ensure full compliance:

    npm install
    npm test

If nothing else, this was a fun exercise. The spec is a bit trickier to implement than you might think!
